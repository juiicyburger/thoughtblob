A utterance into a great void.

I've avoided blogging for a long while now because I don't think I have anything to say (not anything new anyways). I'm scared of being wrong. Of looking a fool.

But [this post](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) by Alexey Guzey has convinced me to start.

Besides, I need a website to play around with to build up my coding skills â€” this is my main hobby/practice outside of work right now.

What can you expect from this blog?

I can't answer that yet. Whatever I spit up onto this blog will answer that in time.

For now I just know that it'll be a place to plop my thoughts and hopefully develop them into some interesting ones.
